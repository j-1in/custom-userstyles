## ✨ About  

This project brings the **Everforest** color palette to websites via **userstyles**.  
It’s a fork of [Catppuccin userstyles](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles), but with the Everforest palette.  

> Everforest is my current favorite theme, but no comprehensive userstyles exist for it, so this project is here to change that!  

---

## Goals  

1. **Everforest Everywhere** – Apply the Everforest theme to popular websites.  
2. **Based on Catppuccin** – Reuse their structure and methodology for easier maintenance.  
3. **Automated Conversions** – Explre automation so future Catppuccin updates can be converted into Everforest.  
4. **Community Driven** – Open for contributions, tweaks, and new styles.

## Installation

- [Stylus (Firefox/Chrome/Edge)](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)  

### Steps:  
1. Install Stylus.  
2. Browse the [styles](./styles) directory.  
3. Pick a site, click **Raw**, and Stylus should prompt you to install.
